##  Overview

The goal of testing was to ensure that the site behaves as expected across different devices and browsers, is accessible, and adheres to semantic and modern coding standards.

---

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing on multiple screen sizes and devices
- Use of online validators (W3C HTML & CSS)
- Testing modal functionality and keyboard accessibility
- Confirmation of feedback display and element visibility

---

## User Stories Testing

### 1. As a user who is overwhelmed, I want to write freely without judgment.
- A clearly labeled check-in form is provided.
- Input is not stored, just acknowledged by a modal popup.

### 2. As a visitor exploring mental health resources, I want to feel welcomed and supported.
-  Resources page displays national and local support services.
- Images and messaging are calm, neutral, and inclusive.

### 3. As a returning user, I want easy navigation and reassurance.
- Navbar is simple and accessible on all screen sizes.
- Footer contains reassurance messaging and icons.

### CSS
- Tested with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
-  No errors found

##  Bugs and Fixes

### 1. **Navbar Logo Positioned Incorrectly**
- **Issue**: Logo appeared outside nav bar on some screen sizes
- **Fix**: Removed conflicting `box-shadow` styling in custom CSS

### 2. **Confirmation Message Not Visible**
- **Issue**: Original hidden `div` went unnoticed after submitting form
- **Fix**: Replaced with a Bootstrap modal that visually confirms submission

### 3. **Aria-labelledby Not Connected Properly**
- **Issue**: Modalâ€™s `aria-labelledby` attribute was not pointing to any element
- **Fix**: Connected it to the `id` of the modal title element

---

## Additional Notes

- Wireframes were created by the developer using **Canva Whiteboard** and tested during layout planning.
- Accessibility was considered from the start: keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and proper ARIA usage were applied.
- Testing was conducted throughout development, not only at the end.
